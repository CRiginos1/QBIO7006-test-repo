# QBIO7006-test-repo
Sandbox for QBIO7006 students


This is a test repo for playing with GitHub. There is nothing to be broken... explore away!
Some more meaningless text.
A line I wrote on my local computer  
Followed by a line written from afar...
... and then pushed back up again.

A careless footprint or two, for the lonely sandbox

Another addition to the readme from the command line... how do I exit Vim 
again?

just another test
